# Hindi Character Classification using CNN

This is my assignment for the **GenAI course** where I built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify Hindi characters using the Devanagari Handwritten Character Dataset.

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source:** [Kaggle - Devanagari Character Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berlinsweird/devanagari)
- The dataset contains handwritten Hindi characters and digits.
- Divided into `train` and `test` folders with one folder per class.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Google Colab (for model training)
- GitHub (for sharing code)

---

## 🧠 What I Did

- Loaded and preprocessed the dataset in Google Colab
- Applied image resizing and normalization
- Built a CNN model using TensorFlow/Keras
- Trained the model on 32x32 resized images
- Evaluated the model on validation data
